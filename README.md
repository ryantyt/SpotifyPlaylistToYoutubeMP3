# Spotify to Youtube to MP3
Description: 
Uses spotipy which connects to spotify api and gets a csv file of liked songs (I don't know how to get from playlist) and then uses that csv file to get ids and then links and then videos off youtube
debugged off a video I saw on youtube as the guy didn't finish the video\
